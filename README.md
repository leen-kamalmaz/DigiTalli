# DigiTalli
DigiTalli counts the number of people entering and exiting a space, checks their temperature, and sends text messages to notify attendees when a store or other location is ready for them to enter. The motivation for this device is to help business owners and optimize the efforts of employees during these difficult times. The device is centred around an Arduino microcontroller, and uses an SMS API to send messages to users once a space is no longer at maximum capacity.
